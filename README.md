## Portfolio

### HERC
In this notebook we try to create a few simple long-only ETF Portfolios using different portfolio optimization methods.
The methods we will look at are: equal risk, Hierarchical Equal Risk Contribution (HERC) and a HERC with a momentum overlay.
The HERC optimization is based on the paper by: [Raffinot, Thomas, The Hierarchical Equal Risk Contribution Portfolio (August 23, 2018)](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3237540 )
The portfolio is then backtested and the results are compared. We try to create a diversified portfolio meanwhile keeping in mind transaction costs.
